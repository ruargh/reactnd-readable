# Readable Project

This is the project for the Udacity React Redux course.
 The application allows users to post content in pre-defined categories. Mechanisms allow user to add, delete and vote on content.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server.

## How to Install and run

* Install and start the API server:
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

* In another terminal window, install and start the front-end:
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
